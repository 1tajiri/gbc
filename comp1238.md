# Notes on Week 2: Representing Text and Numbers in Computers

## Objective
Understand how information is stored in computers, focusing on memory, numbers, and text representation.

## Topics Covered
- Computer memory (**RAM vs storage**).
- Representation of numbers and characters in memory.
- **ASCII table** and text/binary files.

## Computer Memory
- **Bit**: Smallest unit of information, holds two states (0/1, true/false).
- **Byte**: Group of 8 bits, commonly used in modern systems.

### Volatile vs Non-Volatile Memory
- **Volatile**: Erased when power is off (e.g., **RAM**).
- **Non-Volatile**: Long-term storage (e.g., **hard drives, SSDs**).

## Units of Measurement
- **Kilo, Mega, Giga** prefixes (e.g., 1 Megabyte = 8 Megabits).
- **Binary vs Decimal Units**: 1 Kilobyte = 1024 bytes (binary) vs 1000 bytes (decimal).

## Number Systems
- **Binary**: Base-2 system (0,1).
- **Hexadecimal**: Base-16 system (0-9, A-F).
- **Positional Notation**: Value of a digit depends on its position (e.g., 101 in binary = 5 in decimal).

## ASCII Encoding
- **ASCII Table**: Standardizes characters and control codes (e.g., A = 65, B = 66).
- **Extended ASCII**: Uses 128-255 range for additional characters.

## Text Mode
- Early computers used **text mode**, dividing the screen into a grid (e.g., 80x25 characters).
- **Code Pages**: Used for different languages, but often led to compatibility issues.

## Files
- **Text Files**: Bytes interpreted as characters.
- **Binary Files**: Data not meant to be displayed as text (e.g., audio files).

## Lab
- Practice **typing**, focus on **accuracy over speed**.
- Use **GitHub Classroom** for submitting and auto-grading assignments.

# Notes on Week 3: Structure of Text Files

## Objective
Understand the structure of text files, markup languages, and structured data formats.

## Topics Covered
- **Structure of text files** (lines, spaces, paragraphs).
- **Markup languages** (Markdown, HTML).
- **Structured data formats** (JSON, XML).
- **Special characters and escaping**.

## Text Structure
- **Lines**: Separated by newline characters.
- **Whitespace**: Spaces and indentation for readability.
- **Paragraphs**: Blocks of text separated by blank lines.

## Markup Languages
- **Markdown**: Simple markup language for quick documentation.
  - Example: `# Title` for headings, `*italic*` for italic text.
- **HTML**: Used for web pages, rendered by browsers.
  - Example: `<p>Paragraph</p>` for paragraphs.
- **XML**: Extensible Markup Language, used for structured data.

## Structured Data
- **JSON**: JavaScript Object Notation, lightweight and easy to read.
  - Example: `{ "name": "John", "age": 30 }`.
- **XML**: More verbose than JSON, still widely used.
  - Example: `<name>John</name><age>30</age>`.

## Special Characters and Escaping
- **Escaping**: Using backslash (\) to treat special characters as regular text.
  - Example: `\#` to display a literal `#` in Markdown.
- **HTML Character References**: Use `&lt;` for `<` and `&gt;` for `>`.

## Unicode
- **Codepoints**: Assigns numbers to characters (e.g., `U+0061` for 'a').
- **UTF-8**: Variable-width encoding, compatible with ASCII.
  - Example: 'A' in ASCII is `01000001`, same in UTF-8.

## Lab
- Practice **typing** and using **GitHub Classroom** for assignments.
- Focus on **accuracy and understanding text structure**.

## Week 4: Working with Text

### Objective
Master tools used by IT practitioners daily, focusing on keyboards, text editors, and searching in text.

### Topics Covered
- **Keyboards, touch-typing, and keyboard shortcuts.**
- **Text editors:** Notepad, Vi, VSCode.
- **Searching in text:** Wildcards and basics of regexp.
- **Lab prep:** GitHub Pages.

### Mastering the Keyboard
- **Keyboard and mouse** are the main ways to control the computer.

  - `pwd`: Print working directory.
  - `cd`: Change directory.
  - `cat`, `less`: Show file contents.
  - `cp`, `mv`, `mkdir`: Copy, move files, create directories.
  - `ping`: Test network connectivity.

### Command Arguments and Options
- **Arguments:** Inputs to commands (e.g., `git checkout -b "newBranch"`).
- **Options:** Modify command behavior (e.g., `-b` in `git checkout`).

### Redirection and Pipes
- **Redirection:** Send command output to a file (`>` overwrites, `>>` appends).
- **Pipes:** Redirect output to another command (e.g., `ls -la | wc -l`).

### SSH (Secure Shell)
- **Remote control:** Encrypted communication with remote servers.
- **File transfer:** `scp` and `sftp` for secure file copying.

### TUI (Text User Interface)
- **Text-based UIs:** Tools like `htop` for system monitoring.
- **Tmux:** Terminal multiplexer, allows split windows and remote session management.

### Why Use CLI Today?
- Precise control, automation, faster for some tasks, works over slow networks, low resource usage.
