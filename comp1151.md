IT Essentials â€“ Chapter 1 to Chapter 4 Exam Notes

Chapter 1: Introduction to Computers
Computer System Components:

Hardware: Physical components of a computer (e.g., CPU, RAM, motherboard, etc.).
Software: Programs or instructions that tell the computer what to do.
Peripheral Devices: External devices connected to a computer (e.g., printers, keyboards).
System Unit: Enclosure housing core components like the motherboard and power supply.
Types of Computers:

Desktops: Typically used in fixed locations.
Laptops: Portable computers with integrated components.
Tablets/Smartphones: Mobile computing devices with touch interfaces.
Servers: Systems that provide services to other computers or devices.
Computer Power Supply:

ATX Power Supply: Used in most desktop systems.
Wattage: Determines how much power is delivered to the system.
AC to DC Conversion: Converts alternating current to direct current.
Boot Process:

Power-On Self-Test (POST): Checks hardware functionality.
BIOS/UEFI: Firmware that initializes system hardware.
Operating System Load: Loads the OS after POST.
Basic Troubleshooting Steps:

Identify the problem.
Establish a theory.
Test the theory.
Implement a solution.
Verify system functionality.
Document findings.


Chapter 2: Motherboards and CPUs
Motherboard Components:

CPU Socket: Where the processor is installed.
RAM Slots: Hold memory modules.
Expansion Slots: Used for adding additional components (e.g., graphics cards).
Chipset: Manages data between CPU, memory, and other components.
Power Connectors: Provide power to the motherboard.
CPU (Central Processing Unit):

Function: Performs calculations and executes instructions.
Core: Multiple processing units within a CPU.
Clock Speed: Determines the number of instructions a CPU can process per second.
Cache: High-speed memory built into the CPU for frequently used data.
Types of CPU Sockets:

LGA (Land Grid Array): Common socket type, contacts on the motherboard.
PGA (Pin Grid Array): CPU has pins that fit into the socket.
BGA (Ball Grid Array): Soldered directly to the motherboard.
Motherboard Form Factors:

ATX: Standard size, used in most desktops.
Micro-ATX: Smaller size, limited expansion.
Mini-ITX: Compact design for small form factor builds.
Memory (RAM):

DDR (Double Data Rate): Common type of RAM.
RAM Capacity: The amount of memory the motherboard can support.
Troubleshooting:

POST Error Beeps: Indicate hardware failures (e.g., faulty RAM, CPU issues).
BIOS Reset: Resetting CMOS can help fix hardware-related issues.


Chapter 3: Storage Devices
Storage Types:

HDD (Hard Disk Drive): Traditional spinning disk storage, offers large capacity.
SSD (Solid State Drive): Faster than HDD, with no moving parts.
Hybrid Drive: Combines an HDD with SSD cache for performance improvements.
Disk Interfaces:

SATA (Serial ATA): Common interface for connecting storage devices.
SATA III: Faster version of SATA, supports up to 6 Gb/s data transfer rate.
NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express): Faster interface used with SSDs.
RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks):

RAID 0: Striping for performance, no redundancy.
RAID 1: Mirroring for redundancy, slower write speeds.
RAID 5: Striping with parity for a balance of performance and redundancy.
Partitioning:

Primary Partition: The main partition where an OS is installed.
Extended Partition: Used to create multiple logical drives.
Troubleshooting Storage Issues:

Check Disk: Use the chkdsk command to repair file system errors.
Disk Management: Create and manage disk partitions.
SMART: Technology that monitors the health of a storage device.


Chapter 4: Troubleshooting Hardware and Software
Common Hardware Issues:

Overheating: Caused by dust buildup, improper cooling, or failing fans.
No Power: Check the power supply, cables, and motherboard connections.
Slow Performance: Can be caused by insufficient RAM, slow hard drive, or software issues.
Software Troubleshooting:

Corrupted OS Files: Use the System File Checker (sfc /scannow) to repair system files.
Driver Issues: Update or reinstall drivers using Device Manager.
Diagnostic Tools:

Event Viewer: Used to check for system errors and logs.
Device Manager: Used to manage hardware devices and check for driver issues.
Task Manager: Used to monitor system performance and running processes.
MSConfig: A system utility to configure startup options.
Command Prompt: Run commands like chkdsk, sfc, diskpart, etc.
Preventive Maintenance:

Dust Removal: Clean intake fans and internal components to prevent overheating.
Software Updates: Keep operating system and software up-to-date to avoid security vulnerabilities.
Backup: Always ensure backups of important data before troubleshooting.
Documenting the Troubleshooting Process:

Work Order: Include details such as the problem description, actions taken, and results.
Customer Communication: Keep the customer informed and explain how the solution was implemented.
Liability Release: If data loss is possible, have the customer sign a release form.
Final Verification:

Verify System Functionality: After repairs, test the system to ensure all issues have been resolved.
Apply Preventive Measures: Implement steps like updating drivers, cleaning dust, and backing up data to prevent future issues.
Tips for Handling Specific Issues:

CPU Issues: Look for overheating or incorrect installation.
Hard Drive LED Issues: Check if the LED cable is properly connected to the motherboard.
Display Problems: Update or reinstall video drivers and check for hardware failure.
RAM: Ensure proper seating and check for compatibility issues.
